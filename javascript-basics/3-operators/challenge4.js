/* Challenge 4: Division Operator
Task: Create two variables, p and q, with values 16 and 4 respectively. Use the division operator to find the quotient and store it in a variable quotient. Print quotient to the console. */

// SOLUTION

let p = 20;
let q = 8;

let quotient = p / q;
console.log(quotient);

// OUTPUT: 2.5
