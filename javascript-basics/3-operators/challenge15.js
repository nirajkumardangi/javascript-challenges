/* Challenge 15: Logical AND with Comparison Operators
Task: Create three variables, num1, num2, and num3 with values 10, 15, and 20 respectively. Use comparison operators along with the logical AND operator to check if num1 is less than num2 and num2 is less than num3. Print the result. */

// SOLUTION

let num1 = 10
let num2 = 15
let num3 = 30

console.log((num1 < num2) && (num2 < num3));

// OUTPUT: true
